# Backend Operations 
run the backend with the command ```npm start```

# Backend Testing
In order to run the backend tests
1) from the backend folder enter ```npm install``` to download all relevant packages
2) still in the backend folder enter ```npm run...```  and then the test you want (i.e. userTest or appTest)
3) in order to run all tests enter ```npm run tests``` into the commandline

## What has been implemented? 
# Backend
Connection with the MongoDB database has been created and new documents for new apps and users are functional. Methods for each object can be found in their controllers as well as their schema. We also created test scripts. Finally an inital implementation of the routes for frontend to use as an API is underway. Full integration with the frontend is underway.

# Responsibilities
